Hi! I´m Nayane Costa and i´m a analysis and systems development student at João Pessoa University Center - Unipê.
During my undergraduate studies I found myself in the area of ​​programming and specifically in the area of ​​AI and 
backend web development with Python, MySQL and Django.
I created this profile to share my progress in studies and I hope it contributes in some way to you.
Be very welcome!!!
